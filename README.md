# AI-Internship
I would like to share what I did during my two-month artificial intelligence internship in Germany.

First, I recommend reading the poster about Soundwalk made by my boss to understand the reason for the research. Then, in the 'Codes' folder, you can see the different graphs about sound perception, along with the Excel file where the data of a building is compiled. You can also find the artificial intelligence model that predicts people's perception when entering certain building values into the dataset.

It was a period of significant learning since I was able to explore a field I was not familiar with, such as architecture. Integrating both disciplines was a challenge, but the goal was achieved.
