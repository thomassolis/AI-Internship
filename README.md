# AI-Internship
I would like to share what I did during my artificial intelligence internship in Germany for 2 months.

First I recommend to read the poster about Soundwalk made by my boss so you can understand the reason for the research. Then in the folder 'Codes' you can see the different graphs about sound perception together with the excel where the data of a building is compiled. You can also find the artificial intelligence model that allows to predict the perception that people have when entering certain values of a building to the dataset.

It was a period of much learning since I was able to learn a lot about an area that I did not know as architecture and complement both branches was a challenge, but the goal was achieved.
